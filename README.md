- 👋 Hi, I’m @holdenbeast: communist, cowboy, redneck, hippie. Tear down the walls. Free as in speech and beer.
- 👀 I’m interested in gigapixel panoramic imaging, gigapixel image manipulation, epaper, large scale photo printing and content management at scale. I read too much, have a irascible chihuahua and am an adamant antifascist.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything. My tech skills, once passable, have atrophied.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything.
- 📫 I'm findable at michael@michaelholden.com
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I recently was the caretaker of the world'slargest piece of art.
